        The Steps taken to develp a website
        </header>
        <h1>Step One: Design</h1>
        <p>
        This is the fun part. You'll likely talk about color schemes, function, special features , graphics, videos, and the overall look.Bringing websites as other examples is ideal at this stage. After that meeting, the creative team takes some time to bring the vision to life </p>
        <h1>Step Two: Review</h1>
        <p>
        Once the team has had some time to work through the design process it presents the website. This is usually done in person with a presentation. People can discuss the layout, colors, etc. during this time. Often, more meetings will follow as there is need to have some feedback and changes that the creative team  would have to implement. </p>
        <h1>Step Three: Develop</h1>
        <p>
            Now that the design is approved, it is time for the website to go to the developer. The developer starts to build the website on a production server so you can view the site online without it being viewable to the public. During that time, the copywriter and other people in the agency will have to nail down the voice, content, and graphics. This is usually the longest part of the process, but it is the most important!
        </p>
        <h1>Step Four: Test</h1>
        <p>
            Once the website has been coded by the developer and you've settled on all of your content, it is time to review the new site on the test server. A link to view the website and share with your company and decision-makers will be shared for evaluation processes. Usually there are a few tweaks that need to be made at this stage before the site is finalized.
        </p>
        <h1>Step Five: Launch</h1>
        <p>
            At this stage, a new site is ready to launch! Once it has been approved, the developer will start the launching process. This includes setting up hosting and getting the domain pointed. It will also take some time to propagate. Be patient â€” it will be worth it! After a few hours, the site should be live and ready for the rest of the world to enjoy!
